Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Amisha, a dedicated student with a relentless passion for coding and innovation. I've been on an exciting journey in the world of technology from a young age, starting my coding adventure in primary school. Over the years, I've honed my skills and garnered valuable experiences.
- âš¡ My Projects:
        Asclepius- A website that uses a dataset of COVID cases (containing the number of deaths, locality, and effects of comorbidities) to develop a risk factor for an   
        individual who enters their personal health details and locality using machine learning algorithms for personalized results. It also provides heatmaps, line, scatter 
        and bar graphs of dataset given for easy analysis.
        Zesha- An app that helps Dementia patients and their caretakers by acting as a digitalized version of a caretaker. Includes, asnering repetitive questions of the  
        patient, location traking, reminder list, entertainment sites, voice recognition and emergency contacts speedial.
        AirEye- An air quality monitoring portable device, built with the Intel Edison and MQ senors, that shows reading on an LCD and stores the readings for further analysis.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
        EcoSensor Connect- A portable device with NodeMCU that detects air quality and dust, transfers these readings to ThingSpeak to be shown as graphs and then to MatLab, 
        to perform various ML operations on it to find data trends.
        Ink and Insights- A python ML model, that analyses NSO's literacy survery from 2012-2018 and predict the factors that affect literacy and predict the literacy rate in 
        the upcoming years. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning- Tkinter, Matlab, C, WebDev, Arduino

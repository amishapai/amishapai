       1) Asclepius- A website that uses a dataset of COVID cases (containing the number of deaths, locality, and effects of comorbidities) to develop a risk factor for an  individual who enters their personal health details and locality using machine learning algorithms for personalized results. It also provides heatmaps, line, scatter and bar graphs of dataset given for easy analysis.
       2) Zesha- An app that helps Dementia patients and their caretakers by acting as a digitalized version of a caretaker. Includes, answering repetitive questions of the  patient, location traking, reminder list, entertainment sites, voice recognition and emergency contacts speedial.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
        1) EcoSensor Connect- A portable device with NodeMCU that detects air quality and dust, transfers these readings to ThingSpeak to be shown as graphs and then to MatLab, to perform various ML operations on it to find data trends.
        2) Ink and Insights- A python ML model, that analyses NSO's literacy survery from 2012-2018 and predict the factors that affect literacy and predict the literacy rate in the upcoming years.
